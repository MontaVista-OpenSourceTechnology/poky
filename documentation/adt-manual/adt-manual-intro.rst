Welcome to the Yocto Project Application Developer's Guide. This manual
provides information that lets you begin developing applications using
the Yocto Project.

The Yocto Project provides an application development environment based
on an Application Development Toolkit (ADT) and the availability of
stand-alone cross-development toolchains and other tools. This manual
describes the ADT and how you can configure and install it, how to
access and use the cross-development toolchains, how to customize the
development packages installation, how to use command-line development
for both Autotools-based and Makefile-based projects, and an
introduction to the Eclipse IDE Yocto Plug-in.

.. note::

   The ADT is distribution-neutral and does not require the Yocto
   Project reference distribution, which is called Poky. This manual,
   however, uses examples that use the Poky distribution.

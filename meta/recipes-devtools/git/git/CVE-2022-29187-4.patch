Subject: [PATCH] git-compat-util: allow root to access both SUDO_UID and root owned

Previous changes introduced a regression which will prevent root for
accessing repositories owned by thyself if using sudo because SUDO_UID
takes precedence.

Loosen that restriction by allowing root to access repositories owned
by both uid by default and without having to add a safe.directory
exception.

A previous workaround that was documented in the tests is no longer
needed so it has been removed together with its specially crafted
prerequisite.

 As explained, Git only allows you to access repositories owned by

 This is to make it easy to perform a common sequence during installation
 "make && sudo make install".  A git process running under 'sudo' runs as
 'root' but the 'sudo' command exports the environment variable to record
 which id the original user has.
 If that is not what you would prefer and want git to only trust
